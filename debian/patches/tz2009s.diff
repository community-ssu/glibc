+
+# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
+# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A

+# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
+# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
+# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
+# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
+# 
+# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date 
+# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date, 
+# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in 
+# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder 
+# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which 
+# changes two days later.
+
+# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
+# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
+# time:  Energy conservation?"-# No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally

+# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
+#
+# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
+# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
+# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstancial evidence is simply the

+# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
+#
+# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
+# to be wrong. This is now verified.
+#
+# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
+# government, in 'Eidgen[o]ssische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss
+# federal law collection)...
+#
+# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
+# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
+#
+# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
+# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
+#
+# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
+# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
+# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
+# other years are made.
+#
+# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
+# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
+# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
+# a thing had happened in Switzerland.
+#
+# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traite de
+# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
+# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
+# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
+#
+# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
+# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S
+# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -
+#
+# The 1940 rules must be deleted.
+#
+# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
+# most users of tzdata:

+# IMHO, the "spirit of the Law" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd

 # Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:

+# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
+# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
+# Oficial da Uniao"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
+# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
+#
+# a) The timezone UTC+5 is e[x]tinguished, with all the Acre state and the
+# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
+# timezone UTC+4
+# b) The whole Para state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
+# part of it, as was before.
+#
+# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
+# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
+# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
+# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
+# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
+# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
+# 1913.
+
+# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
+# Just correcting the URL:
+# <a href="https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008">
+# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008
+# </a>
+#
+# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
+# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
+# be created to represent the the west side of the Para State. I
+# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
+# important/populated city in the affected area.
+#
+# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
+# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.
+
+# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
+# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.

+#
+# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones-eliminating time zone UTC- 05
+# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT- 04) - western
+# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC- 03 (from UTC -04).

 # </a>.
 
+# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):
+# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late
+# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and
+# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on
+# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that
+# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.
