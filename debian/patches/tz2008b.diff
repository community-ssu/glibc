 # From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
 # The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
-# southern coast of Australia, population 10 at last report, along with
-# 50,000 sheep, about 100 kilometers long and 40 kilometers into the
-# continent.  The primary town is Madura, with the other towns being
-# Mundrabilla and Eucla.  According to the sheriff of Madura, the
-# residents got tired of having to change the time so often, as they are
-# located in a strip overlapping the border of South Australia and Western
-# Australia.  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
+# southern coast....  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
 # Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
 # residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
 # much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
 # international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
-# Australia and Western Australia.  As it only affects about 10 people and
-# tourists staying at the Madura Motel, it has never really made as big an
-# impact as Broken Hill.  However, as tourist visiting there or anyone
-# calling the local sheriff will attest, they do keep time in this way.
+# Australia and Western Australia....
 #
 # From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
 # This is confirmed by the section entitled
 # "What's the deal with time zones???" in
-# <http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html>,
-# which says a few other things:
+# <http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html>.
 #
-# * Border Village, SA also is 45 minutes ahead of Perth.
-# * The locals call this time zone "central W.A. Time" (presumably "CWAT").
-# * The locals also call Western Australia time "Perth time".
-#
-# It's not clear from context whether everyone in Western Australia
-# knows of this naming convention, or whether it's just the people in
-# this subregion.

-# South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria
+# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
+# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
+# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
+# coast of the continent.
+#
+# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
+# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
+# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
+# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
+# the largest population centre in this zone....
+#
+# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
+# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
+# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
+# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
+#
+# (2006-12-09):
+# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
+# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
+# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well

 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
 # New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
 # CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
 # violation of the official Ontario rules.
-# They also write that Quebec east of the -63 meridian is supposed to
-# observe AST, but residents as far east as Natashquan use EST/EDT,
-# and residents east of Natashquan use AST.
-# We probably need Zones for far east Quebec and for Atikokan,
-# but we don't know when their practices started.
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
+# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
+# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
+#
+#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
+#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
+#	the other half on eastern time.
+#
+#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
+#
+#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
+#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
+#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
+#
+# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
+# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."
+
+# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
+# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
+# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
+# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
+# time keeping since 1952, at least.
+
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
+# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
+# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
+# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
+# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
+# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
+# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
+# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

+# I think that there are some obvious mistakes in the suggested link
+# from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66 says that GMT-4
+# ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at 1990-09-15
+# (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16 respectively), but

+# Jesper Norgaard Welen.  The data for Pacific/Easter are from Shanks
+# & Pottenger, except with DST transitions after 1932 cloned from
+# America/Santiago.  The pre-1980 Pacific/Easter data are dubious,
+# but we have no other source.
