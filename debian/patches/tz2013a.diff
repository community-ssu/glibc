+# From Paul Eggert (2013-10-03):
+# To estimate what the Moroccan government will do in future years,

+# the following program under GNU Emacs 24.3:
+#
+# (let ((islamic-year 1435))
+#   (while (< islamic-year 1461)
+#     (let ((a
+#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute

+#     (setq islamic-year (+ 1 islamic-year))))
+#
+# with spring-forward transitions removed for 2023-2025, when the
+# normal spring-forward date falls during the estimated Ramadan; with
+# all transitions removed for 2026-2035, where the estimated Ramadan
+# falls entirely outside daylight-saving time; and with fall-back
+# transitions removed for 2036-2037, where the normal fall-back
+# date falls during the estimated Ramadan.  Normally, the table would
+# stop after 2037 because 32-bit time_t values roll around early in 2038,
+# but that would imply a prediction of perpetual DST after March 2038
+# due to the year-2037 glitches.  So, this table instead stops after

-#
-# The individual that answered the phone confirmed that the clocks did not

-# From Chris Walton (2008-11-13):
-# ...the residents of Resolute believe that they are changing "time zones"
-# twice a year.  In winter months, local time is qualified with "Eastern
-# Time" which is really "Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5)".  In summer
-# months, local time is qualified with "Central Time" which is really
-# "Central Daylight Time (UTC-5)"...
+# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
+# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
+# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
+# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
+# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
+#
+# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
+# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
+#
+# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
+# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
+# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
+# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
+# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
+# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
+# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
+# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
+# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
+#
+# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
+# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
+# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
+# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
+# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
+# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
+# and worked in Resolute Bay...
+#
+# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
+# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
+# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
+# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
+# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
+# tell me when the practice had stopped.
+#
+# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
+# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
+# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
+# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
+# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
+# Aziz:
+# <a href="http://www.uphere.ca/node/493">
+# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
+# </a>
+#
+# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
+# Eastern Standard Time.
+#
+# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
+# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
+# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
+# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
+#
+# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
+#
+# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz

+#
+# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would

 # For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no

+# We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:
+# Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the
+# third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3
+# hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.
+#
+# IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands
+# will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer
+# time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term
+# change to local time following the trial period will be notified.
+#
+# From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)
+# A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,
+# Cable & Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)
+# states...
+#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the
+#   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.
+#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed
+#   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or
+#   the maintainers of the database to inform them we're adopting
+#   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.
+#
+# For now we will assume permanent summer time for the Falklands
+# until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011
+# experiment was apparently successful.)
